Hi! I'm Dan. I work on internal tools on the Architecture team at
[Sharecare][], where I'm currently working on converting our
microservices to Kubernetes by building a container-optimized CI & CD
infrastructure layer with custom integrations for our development
lifecycle.

On occasion, I write in my [code & web blog][] and explore
[side projects][] whenever I can spin out my work into open source
projects. Outside of coding, I enjoy [playing ultimate][], going
[snowboarding][], and playing a smattering of instruments.
